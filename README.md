## LuckyDuckInvestigation Exploit

This .sh file is a bash script I wrote for my Cyber Security Bootcamp assignment to find who the game dealer was during a specified time and game for the Lucky Ducky Investigation.

We were tasked to create a bash script that took user import using grep and awk. It took me a good chunk of time to come up with the script that I am presenting here as I was pretty new to writing bash scripts which means my code isnâ€™t very secure. Once the asignment was completed, I took it upon myself to exploit my own code.

I found that as long as you meet the IF requirment of a game, then the rest of the argument was able to run with the order of TIME > PAM > DATE > GAME.

So if x = GAME, then awk DATE and grep TIME and PAM.

This means I had 3 user input values I can manipulate as long as I specifiy one of the 3 games for my 4th value.

A LOT of trial and error lead me to find the first exploit - Local File Inclusion.

changing the input from

```sh
8 AM 0310 BlackJack
```
to
```sh
8 ../../../ ../../../../ BlackJack
```
outputs the names of directories on the machine
```sh
~#5 ../../../../../../ ../../../../../../../ TexasHoldEm

This was an exciting discovery but I wanted to be more specific and eventually narrowed it down to dump the /etc/passwd file by grepping x and : and specifying the path to the file

```sh
~#x : /etc/passwd Roulette
